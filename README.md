# Warcry
  Warcry is a microcomputer based project to assess the software and
 hardware capabilities of both 802.11b/g/n and  software defined radio
 in a mesh networked (MANET) environment.

# Project Goals
 1. Raspberry Pi Build 0.1
  - Wireless Mesh Networking configuration
   > ( AWUS036H & TP-Link WN722N )
  - SDR Setup
   > RTL-SDR

 2. Multi-Functional High Gain YAGI Antenna
  - 802.11b/g/n (Longest possible distance)
  - Bluetooth (1-3km)
  - RTL-SDR Radio
